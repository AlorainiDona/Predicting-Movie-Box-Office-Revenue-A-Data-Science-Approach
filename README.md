**Project Overview**

This project aims to predict worldwide box office revenue for movies using machine learning techniques. By analyzing factors like production budget, runtime, IMDb ratings, and audience votes, we can estimate a movie’s potential earnings.

**Repository Contents**

Predicting Movie Box Office Revenue.ipynb – Main notebook for data processing, model training, and evaluation.

README.md – Documentation for the project, including methodology and results.

movie_statistic_dataset.csv – The dataset used in this analysis.

**Libraries Used**

- pandas – Data manipulation

- numpy – Numerical operations

- matplotlib & seaborn – Data visualization

- scikit-learn – Machine learning models and evaluation

**Methodology**

This project follows the CRISP-DM process:

1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- Histograms to understand feature distributions.

- Correlation heatmaps to identify relationships.

- Outlier removal for better predictions.

2. Feature Engineering & Data Processing

- Log transformation for highly skewed variables (budget, revenue, votes).

- Feature selection focusing on key numerical attributes.

3. Model Training & Evaluation

- Linear Regression (Baseline model) → R² = 0.68

- Random Forest Regressor (Improved model) → R² = 0.72

- Hyperparameter Tuning (GridSearchCV) → R² = 0.73

4. Prediction Scenario

- Predicted a new movie’s revenue using the trained model.

- Example Movie: $200M budget, 130 min runtime, 7.5 IMDb rating, 500K votes.

- Prediction: $565.9M worldwide revenue.

**Key Findings**

- Budget and audience engagement are major predictors of box office success.

- Random Forest outperformed Linear Regression, capturing nonlinear relationships better.

- Genre-based revenue analysis could be a next step for improvement.
